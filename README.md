# üìà Stock Market Dashboard

A **React + Tailwind CSS** component that fetches real-time stock prices with **fallback mechanisms**, caching, and responsive UI.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Fetches stock data from **Alpha Vantage** and falls back to **Finnhub** if the primary API fails.
- Uses **localStorage caching** (2-minute cache) to reduce API calls.
- Shows **sample data** if all API requests fail.
- **Responsive UI**: Table for desktop, cards for mobile.
- **Loading state** with a **spinner**.
- Clean and professional design using **Tailwind CSS**.

## üß© Problem

Fetching real-time stock prices comes with challenges:

1. Limited API calls from free providers.
2. API failures or rate limits.
3. Maintaining a smooth user experience while fetching data.

---

## üí° Approach

- **Cache data** locally for 2 minutes to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- **Try multiple APIs**:
  - Primary: Alpha Vantage
  - Fallback: Finnhub
- If both fail, display **sample data** to keep the UI usable.
- **Loading spinner** while fetching.
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & Deployment

This project uses **GitHub + Netlify** for continuous deployment.  

- Whenever you push changes to the `main` branch, Netlify automatically rebuilds and redeploys the app.
- The **build command** is `npm run build` and the **publish directory** is `dist` (generated by Vite).
- A `_redirects` file ensures React Router works correctly on Netlify.
